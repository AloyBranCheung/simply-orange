# Simply Orange Price Tracking App
Tech Stack: React, Typescript, Material UI, Highchart.js 

## Why? 
Because I can. Because every time I shop at Loblaws the prices change from as low as $3.99 to as high at $8.99. Conspiracy? I think not. Time to track the prices I buy my oranges at and graph them up. Because I'm here to save the world. Conspiracists unite.
